# RLG Websites site
Full site: rlgwebsites.com.mx
## Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- CSS (SASS)
- HTML
## Implementations:
### Responsive Navigation Bar
I implemented a responsive navbar with Javascript which in smaller devices turns into a hamburger menu, and in bigger devices takes form in a regular old navbar.
### Effective responsiveness
With the help of functions like clamp in CSS, I minimized the usage of media queries, thus reduncing and cleaning out my CSS code.
